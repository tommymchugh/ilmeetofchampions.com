      <h1>COVID-19 Update</h1>
      <p>Due to the likely restrictions the state of IL will be under in Late July we are changing the format of the meet from a one day meet to a multiday meet.
          The  meet date is now changed from June 27th to the last week in July and first day of August. <br /> 
          We will host 2 events per day: <br />
          • 1st event at 3:30PM<br />
          • 2nd event at 6:00PM<br />
          • 50 athletes per event<br />
          • 25 athletes per gender<br />
          There will be a time gap between events to allow for one group of 50 to clear the venue before the next group of 50 arrive.

        <h1>Our Community</h1>
        <p>
        North Lawndale is one of the most architecturally eccentric and socially complex neighborhoods in Chicago. The area has gone through many cultural shifts, beginning with its origins as a largely Italian and Irish population at its inception in the mid-1800s. In, the early 1900s, Lawndale became the third largest Jewish community in the world. Following World War II, the neighborhood transitioned to become the first African-American community on Chicago’s west side. As a community experiencing frequent waves of migrants and cultures, Lawndale was a testing ground for ideas and activism. Its residents provided important contributions to Zionism, civil rights, housing policies, industrial psychology and scientific management, community organizing and the Black Power movement. In addition to its significant social and historical assets, Lawndale has an incredible “built environment” that has been celebrated by a number of architectural and historical advocacy groups. Several charter schools have opened in an effort to enhance the community’s educational infrastructure. North Lawndale’s proximity to Chicago’s Loop, the University of Illinois at Chicago, the Illinois Medical District, and other important Chicago institutions makes it a highly desirable location for investment, both residentially and commercially. North Lawndale is also the “buckle on the Greystone belt”, containing a high concentration of historic homes with limestone facades. NHS has recently launched the Historic Chicago Greystone Initiative ® in North Lawndale, a project which promotes the documentation, preservation, and repair of these beautiful buildings.
